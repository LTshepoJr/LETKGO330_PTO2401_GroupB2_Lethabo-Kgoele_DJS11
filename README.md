## Introduction

[**The Voice Pod**](https://effervescent-nasturtium-f7b697.netlify.app/) is an advanced, fully responsive web application using **React**, with **TypeScript** for the dynamic and reusable components, and **CSS** for the project's styling. The reliability of code will be ensured by using **TypeScript**, which uses type-checking, while the style will be encapsulated using **CSS** modules. Therefore, the overall result is an application scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly that can be taken as boilerplate and put to use by any web developer who decides to implement this or a similar project.
